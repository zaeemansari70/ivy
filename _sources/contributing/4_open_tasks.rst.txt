Here, we explain all tasks which are currently open for
contributions from the community!

This section of the docs will be updated frequently, whereby new tasks will be added and
completed tasks will be removed. The tasks outlined here are generally broad high-level
tasks, each of which is made up of many individual sub-tasks,
distributed across task-specific
`ToDo list issues <https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AToDo>`_.

The tasks currently open are:

#. Function Formatting
#. Frontend APIs

We try to explain these tasks as clearly as possible, but in cases where things are not
clear, then please feel free to engage with the `open tasks discussion`_,
or reach out on `discord`_ in the `open tasks channel`_!

Please always use the latest commit on GitHub when working on any of these tasks,
**DO NOT** develop your code using the latest PyPI release of :code:`ivy-core`.

Function Formatting
-------------------

Currently, we have many ToDo list issues
`open <https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Function+Reformatting%22+label%3AToDo>`_
for a general function formatting task,
which is explained below.

Each function in each submodule should be updated to follow the implementation
instructions given in the :ref:`Deep Dive` section.
The updates should be applied for the:

#. ivy API
#. all backend APIs
#. container static methods
#. array instance methods
#. container instance methods
#. array operators
#. array reverse operators
#. container operators
#. container reverse operators

The :ref:`Deep Dive` is an **essential** resource for learning how each of these
functions/methods should be implemented. Before starting any contribution task,
you should go through the :ref:`Deep Dive`, and familiarize yourself with the content.

At the time of writing, many of the functions are not implemented as they should be.
You will need to make changes to the current implementations,
but you do not need to address *all* sections of the :ref:`Deep Dive` in detail.
Specifically, you **do not** need to address the following:

#. implement the hypothesis testing for the function
#. get the tests passing for your function, if they are failing before you start

However, everything else covered in the :ref:`Deep Dive` must be addressed.
Some common important tasks are:

#. remove all :code:`lambda` and direct bindings for the backend functions
   (in :code:`ivy.functional.backends`), with each function instead defined using
   :code:`def`.
#. implement the following if they don't exist but should do: :code:`ivy.Array` instance
   method, :code:`ivy.Container` static method, :code:`ivy.Container` instance method,
   :code:`ivy.Array` special method, :code:`ivy.Array` reverse special method,
   :code:`ivy.Container` special method, :code:`ivy.Container` reverse special method.
#. Make sure that the aforementioned methods are added into the correct
   category-specific parent class, such as :code:`ivy.ArrayWithElementwise`,
   :code:`ivy.ContainerWithManipulation` etc.
#. correct all of the :ref:`Function Arguments` and the type hints for every
   function **and** its *relevant methods*, including those you did not implement
   yourself.
#. add the correct :ref:`Docstrings` to every function **and** its *relevant methods*,
   including those you did not implement yourself.
#. add thorough :ref:`Docstring Examples` for every function **and** its
   *relevant methods*

Frontend APIs
-------------

For this task, the goal will be to implement functions for each of the
frontend functional APIs (see :ref:`Ivy as a Transpiler`),
with frontend APIs implemented for:
:code:`JAX`, :code:`MXNet`, :code:`NumPy`, :code:`TensorFlow` and :code:`PyTorch`.

Currently, we have many ToDo list issues
`open <https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AToDo+label%3A%22JAX+Frontend%22%2C%22TensorFlow+Frontend%22%2C%22PyTorch+Frontend%22%2C%22NumPy+Frontend%22>`_
for this task, which is explained below.

The general workflow for this task is:

#. implement the function by following the `Ivy Frontends`_ guide
#. write tests for your function by following the `Ivy Frontend Tests`_ guide
#. verify that the tests for your function are passing

**Round Up**

This should have hopefully given you a good understanding of the basics for contributing.

If you're ever unsure of how best to proceed,
